#JavaScript Core Skills Review and Reinforcement

**"Repetition is the mother of all learning."**

What's up! This repo is basically my personal playground for diving back into JavaScript.

I'm using this awesome course: [complete-javascript-course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course) to get a grip on the fundamentals again. You know, not just writing code that works, but actually understanding the "why" behind it all.

### My Journey to the Final Boss

Here's what I'm focused on:

* **Deep Dives, Not Just Doodles:** I'm not just gonna copy and paste stuff. I'm getting into the nitty-gritty of concepts like **Closures**, **Prototype Chains**, and the super weird `this` keyword.
* **Code My Way:** I'm tackling each project on my own first. Then, I'll compare my code to the solution to see what I missed and find better ways to do things.
* **Leaving a Trail:** My **commit messages** and code comments are gonna be my breadcrumbs. They'll show my thought process and all the epic wins (and fails) along the way.

This repo isn't the finish line, it's just the starting point. It's my little corner of the internet for showing off my passion and proving I'm ready to build some seriously cool stuff. Thanks again to original author Jonas!

Thanks for stopping by!
